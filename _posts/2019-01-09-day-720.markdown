1/ **Trump abruptly walked out of a closed-door meeting about the partial government shutdown with congressional leaders.** Sen. Chuck Schumer said Trump stood up and "just walked out of the meeting" after Nancy Pelosi said she wouldn't fund his border wall even if he ended the shutdown. Trump then confirmed Schumer's story in a tweet, calling the meeting "a total waste of time." He tweeted: "I asked what is going to happen in 30 days if I quickly open things up, are you going to approve Border Security which includes a Wall or Steel Barrier? Nancy said, NO. I said bye-bye, nothing else works!"

* **Trump once again warned that he might declare a national emergency in order to bypass Congress to build his border wall.** "I have the absolute right to do national emergency if I want," Trump said when asked what he would do if he is unable to reach a deal with Democrats to fund the wall. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/us/politics/trump-wall-national-emergency.html))

* **The Democratic response to last night's national address received slightly higher ratings than Trump's actual remarks.** Trump's remarks scored a combined 28.1 in the preliminary numbers from Nielsen, while the Democratic response scored a 29.3 across the same networks.

2/ **The Supreme Court refused to intervene in a mysterious case that is believed to involve Robert Mueller and an unidentified foreign-owned company.** Mueller subpoenaed "Company A," as it is referred to in court documents, but the company insists it has immunity and that complying with a U.S. Grand Jury subpoena would violate the laws of its home country. The court offered no explanation as to why it declined to intervene in the case and many case details remain shrouded in secrecy. The company is believed to be a foreign financial institution.

3/ **A law firm that has represented both Russian interests and the Republican Party is involved in the mystery subpoena case between Robert Mueller and "Company A."** The high-powered law firm Alston & Bird previous represented the Republican National Committee in an effort to obtain some of Hillary Clinton's emails. Alston & Bird also represented Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, who loaned Paul Manafort $10 million. It is unclear whether Alston & Bird is currently representing "Company A," the country that owns "Company A," or the regulators of that country.

4/ **The leaders of seven committees in the House of Representatives called on Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to explain why the U.S. decided to ease sanctions against companies linked to Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska.** The committee chairs wrote to Mnuchin and called on him to explain a December announcement that the United States will lift sanctions against three companies connected to Deripaska, including an aluminum manufacturing giant called Rusal. The move still keeps Deripaska on a blacklist of sanctioned oligarchs with close ties to the Kremlin, but Democrats say the deal allows Deripaska to maintain "significant ownership" of one of the companies.
